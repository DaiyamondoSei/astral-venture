# Coding Standards

This document outlines our application's coding standards and best practices to maintain consistency and quality across the codebase.

## Type Safety

1. **Strong Type Definitions**:
   - Always define explicit types for function parameters and return values
   - Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
   - Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/primitives

2. **Type Guards**:
   - Implement proper type guards when dealing with dynamic data
   - Use discriminated unions for complex state management
   - Create reusable type guards for common patterns

3. **API Response Types**:
   - Define exhaustive types for all API responses
   - Use consistent naming patterns (e.g., `EntityResponse`, `EntityListResponse`)
   - Create utility types for pagination, filtering, and sorting

## Component Architecture

1. **Component Composition**:
   - Create small, focused components with single responsibilities
   - Use composition instead of inheritance for component reuse
   - Keep component files under 300 lines of code

2. **State Management**:
   - Use local state for UI-specific concerns
   - Use context for shared state across component trees
   - Extract complex state logic into custom hooks

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use PascalCase for components and component files
   - Use camelCase for variables, functions, and hooks
   - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
   - Prefix boolean props with "is", "has", or "should"

## Performance Optimization

1. **Memoization**:
   - Use React.memo for components that render often but rarely change
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components

2. **Rendering Optimization**:
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by properly structuring state
   - Use key props correctly in lists
   - Implement virtualization for long lists

3. **Code Splitting**:
   - Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
   - Lazy load components that are not needed during initial render
   - Optimize bundle size by removing unused dependencies

## Error Handling

1. **Centralized Error Handling**:
   - Implement consistent error boundaries around major features
   - Create a unified error logging and reporting system
   - Use standardized error types across the application

2. **Form Validation**:
   - Use a consistent validation library throughout the application
   - Implement both client-side and server-side validation
   - Provide clear, user-friendly error messages

3. **API Error Handling**:
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Show appropriate fallback UI during error states

## Testing Standards

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all utility functions
   - Test complex business logic thoroughly
   - Use mock data for predictable tests

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Test component rendering and interactions
   - Test edge cases and error states
   - Ensure accessibility requirements are met

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test component compositions and workflows
   - Verify data flow between components
   - Test side effects and asynchronous operations

## Documentation

1. **Code Comments**:
   - Document complex algorithms and business logic
   - Explain "why" rather than "what" in comments
   - Use JSDoc for public API functions and components

2. **README Files**:
   - Include setup instructions for new developers
   - Document architecture decisions and patterns
   - Provide examples for complex features

3. **Architectural Documentation**:
   - Maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams
   - Document service interactions and dependencies
   - Keep a record of major design decisions

## Version Control

1. **Commit Messages**:
   - Write descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose
   - Follow a consistent format (e.g., conventional commits)
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

2. **Branch Strategy**:
   - Use feature branches for all new work
   - Keep branches small and focused
   - Regularly merge from main to avoid drift

3. **Code Reviews**:
   - Review all code before merging to main
   - Focus on correctness, maintainability, and performance
   - Automate style and linting checks

By following these standards, we ensure a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality codebase that can scale with our application's growth.
