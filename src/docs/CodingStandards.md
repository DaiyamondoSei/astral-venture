# Coding Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for our project to ensure code quality, maintainability, and type safety.

## 1. TypeScript Type Checking Enforcement

- Use TypeScript's strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Enforce explicit return types on functions
- Avoid using `any` type and prefer more specific types
- Use proper interfaces for all component props and state
- Leverage type guards for runtime type validation
- Implement pre-commit hooks for TypeScript validation

## 2. Consistent Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and props
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- For database entities, use consistent naming patterns (e.g., connections should use from/to, not source/target)
- Document naming conventions in this guide and enforce them with linting rules

## 3. Code Modularity and Testing

- Create small, focused components with single responsibilities
- Keep files under 150 lines of code
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Create utility functions for shared operations
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components
- Implement integration tests for complex interactions

## 4. Error Handling

- Use the centralized error handling system
- Ensure all async operations have proper error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Use error boundaries for component-level error handling

## 5. Performance Considerations

- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo and useCallback
- Implement virtualization for large lists
- Optimize render cycles and avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Load resources lazily when possible

## 6. Code Quality Automation

- Run ESLint as part of the development and build process
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Implement pre-commit hooks to catch issues early
- Run test suites before merging code
- Use TypeScript strict mode for better type safety

## 7. Migration Process for Breaking Changes

When making breaking changes to interfaces or APIs:

1. Add support for the new pattern while maintaining backward compatibility
2. Update all usages to use the new pattern
3. Mark the old pattern as deprecated with proper JSDoc comments
4. Eventually remove the deprecated pattern in a future release

## 8. Documentation Standards

- Add JSDoc comments for all functions and interfaces
- Document complex logic and algorithms
- Keep documentation updated when changing code
- Create diagrams for complex systems
- Document design decisions and architectural choices

By following these standards, we can ensure a high-quality, maintainable, and type-safe codebase.
