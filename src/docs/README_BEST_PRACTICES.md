# Best Practices Documentation

This directory contains best practices documents that provide guidance on TypeScript, React, and code organization patterns used throughout this project.

## Core Type Safety Documents

- **[Interface Synchronization](./INTERFACE_SYNCHRONIZATION.md)**: Patterns and practices for keeping interfaces and implementations in sync.
- **[Type Value Pattern](./TYPE_VALUE_PATTERN.md)**: How to properly handle concepts that need to exist as both types and runtime values.
- **[Interface Consistency Guide](./INTERFACE_CONSISTENCY_GUIDE.md)**: Detailed guide on maintaining interface consistency across the codebase.
- **[Type Safety Best Practices](./TYPE_SAFETY_BEST_PRACTICES.md)**: General TypeScript best practices for maintaining type safety.

## Validation and Error Handling

- **[Validation Types](./TYPE_SAFETY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**: Implementation guide for the validation system.

## Additional Resources

- **[Type vs. Value Best Practices](./TYPE_VS_VALUE_PATTERN_BEST_PRACTICES.md)**: Detailed exploration of the type vs. value pattern.

## When to Apply These Patterns

### Use Interface Synchronization When:
- Creating new hooks that will be consumed by multiple components
- Updating existing hooks with new functionality
- Refactoring component prop interfaces

### Use Type Value Pattern When:
- Working with string literals that need to be used in comparisons
- Creating enums or constant sets that will be used both as types and values
- Implementing features that require type checking and runtime comparison

### Use Validation Patterns When:
- Working with user input
- Processing API data
- Applying transformations to data structures

## Contributing to Best Practices

When you identify a new pattern or solution to a common problem:

1. Create a new documentation file in this directory
2. Follow the established format (Problem, Solution, Examples)
3. Add your document to this README
4. Reference the document in relevant code with JSDoc comments
